 **Linear Programming Problem Solver**

This repository contains solutions to 10 different linear programming problems. Each problem involves optimizing (maximizing or minimizing) an objective function subject to various constraints. The solutions include step-by-step mathematical explanations, Python implementations using `scipy.optimize`, and visualizations of the feasible regions and optimal solutions.

 **Problems Covered**

 **1. Maximizing Profit for Two Products**
- Objective: Maximize profit from Products A and B using limited machine time and raw materials.
- Constraints: Machine hours, material units.

 **2. Minimizing Cost for Manufacturing**
- Objective: Minimize production costs for Products X and Y.
- Constraints: Labor hours, material usage.

  **3. Resource Allocation for a Factory**
- Objective: Maximize profit from Products A and B with restrictions on labor, material, and machine time.

 **4. Optimizing Advertising Revenue**
- Objective: Maximize revenue by allocating a budget across campaigns A and B.
- Constraints: Advertising budget, production capacity.

  **5. Project Selection**
- Objective: Maximize profits by allocating labor and capital to Projects P1 and P2.

  **6. Bakery Production Optimization**
- Objective: Maximize profit from chocolate and vanilla cakes with limited baking time and flour.

  **7. Minimizing Transport Costs**
- Objective: Minimize transportation costs by optimizing trips for vehicles X and Y.
- Constraints: Fuel hours, driver time.

  **8. Manufacturing Revenue Maximization**
- Objective: Maximize revenue from Products P1 and P2 with labor, raw material, and machine time constraints.

  **9. Advertising Campaign Budget Allocation**
- Objective: Maximize reach for campaigns A and B given budget and media constraints.
 **10. School Cafeteria Meal Planning**
- Objective: Maximize revenue from meals A and B with ingredient availability constraints.

 **Uploading to GitHub**

 

1. **Initialize a Repository**:
   - Navigate to your project folder:
     ```bash
     cd <your_project_directory>
     ```
   - Initialize Git:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add all files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the files:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit: Added linear programming solutions"
     ```

2. **Create a Repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
   - Click the "+" icon at the top right, then "New repository."
   - Name your repository and set it to public or private.
   - Do **NOT** initialize with a README or `.gitignore` (we'll add them locally).

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Copy the repository URL provided by GitHub.
   - Add the remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository_url>
     ```
   - Push your files:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```

4. **Verify**:
   - Visit your GitHub repository URL to see your uploaded files.
